# 480-FW

## Summary

We are going to create a VM

## Setup

* SuperMicro Server
  * 64GB RAM
  * 500GB Storage
  * ESXi Installed
* ESXi Host Configuration
  * ISO directory created with ISOs present
  * Virtual switch called 480-WAN configured with port group also called 480-WAN
* Login to ESXi Host

## Step-by-step

* Creating the vyOS Virtual Machine
  * On the home page of the ESXi host, select _**Create/Register VM**_. Follow the VM creation wizard.
    * Select Creation Type
      * Create a new virtual Machine
    * Select Name and Guest OS

    * Select Storage
      * I have no other storage devices in my server, so I have to use datastore1-super27.

    * Customize Settings
      * CPU: 1-core
      * Memory: 1024 MB
      * Hard Drive: 8 GB (Thin Provisioned)
      * CD/ROM Drive: Datastore ISO > `datastore1-super27/ISOs/vyos-1.4-rolling-202301111512-amd64.iso`
      * Network Adapters
        * Network Adapter 1: VM Network
        * Network Adapter 2: VM Network
    * Ready to Complete

* Configuring VyOS VM for Cloning
  * It is important to eliminate all machine-specific data when creating a base VM. There is not one simple sysprep.exe function in VyOS so there is some work that we need to do. The VyOS shell is very similar to Cisco CLI, so I will be describing these steps as if I was working on a Cisco router.
  * Power on VM
  * Boot into VyOS Live Boot
  * Log in with default username and password for VyOS
    * Username: vyos
    * Password: vyos
  * Install VyOS image (because we are in a live boot at the moment)
    * `install image`
  * Go through the installation script and answer the prompts. When asked for a password for an administrator account, make it a generic password that people being delivered the clones can use without compromising any important password (ex. P@ssw0rd!)
  * Reboot the machine and then log in with the new administrator account you have created.
  * Enter global configuration mode and show interfaces
    * `configure`
    * `show interfaces`
  * Delete MAC addresses of network interfaces. We want the machine to re-learn its MAC address the next time it is booted (which will be as a clone).
    * `delete interfaces ethernet eth0 hw-id`
    * `delete interfaces ethernet eth1 hw-id`
  * These changes are saved in a temporary configuration file sort of thing, and we need to tell the machine to actually make those changes to the RUNNING configuration (this will not effect startup config).
    * `commit`
  * Allow DHCP on one interface
    * `set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp`
  * Allow SSH connections from within your private network
    * `set service ssh listen-address 0.0.0.0`
    * `commit`
  * Save the current running configuration to the startup config file
    * `save`
  * Log out and shut down
    * `exit`
    * `poweroff`
  * Remove ISO file from CD/ROM drive
  * Take snapshot of VM and give it a name that is generic and easy to put into code. (ex: base)
* Configure 480-FW for production
  * Set interface IP addresses and descriptions
  * Set DNS
  * Set NAT Service
