### Summary

### Step-by-step

* Webshells like simple-backdoor.php are effective but are not terribly stealthy. Basic IDS/IPS systems will be able to detect "shell-like" behavior by seeing content that looks like commands, prompts and sensitive files like /etc/passwd.
* Target pippin with a traditional webshell (one without encryption or obfuscation). Capture a dump of /etc/passwd using Wireshark on your interface.
